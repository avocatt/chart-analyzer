# Bitcoin Mean Reversion Statistical Analyzer Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the development plan for a statistical analyzer that examines Bitcoin price behavior after breaks of previous day's high and low levels. The goal is to determine if there are exploitable patterns in how price moves after these key level breaks.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Data Preparation
- [x] **1.1 Project Structure Setup**
  - [x] Create directory structure
  - [x] Initialize git repository
  - [x] Set up virtual environment
  - [x] Create README.md with project overview

- [x] **1.2 Data Validation and Cleaning**
  - [x] Load and validate BTCUSDT_1d.csv and BTCUSDT_1m.csv
  - [x] Ensure correct datetime formatting
  - [x] Verify alignment between daily and minute data

- [x] **1.3 Data Preprocessing Module**
  - [x] Create data_loader.py for consistent data loading
  - [x] Implement functions to merge/align daily and minute data
  - [x] Add utility functions for datetime handling
  - [x] Create unit tests for data processing functions

## Phase 2: Core Analysis Engine
- [x] **2.1 Break Detection Module**
  - [x] Implement find_level_break() function with configurable parameters
  - [x] Add support for different break confirmation methods
  - [ ] Create visualization of detected breaks
  - [ ] Write unit tests for break detection

- [x] **2.2 Post-Break Analysis Module**
  - [x] Implement analyze_post_break() function
  - [x] Create metrics for continuation vs. reversal behavior
  - [x] Develop functions to measure time to reach thresholds
  - [x] Add support for different analysis windows

- [x] **2.3 Statistical Summary Module**
  - [x] Implement summarize_break_statistics() function
  - [x] Create aggregate metrics across all break instances
  - [ ] Add statistical significance testing
  - [x] Generate summary tables with key findings

## Phase 3: Extended Analysis Features
- [x] **3.1 Time-Based Analysis**
  - [x] Add time-of-day analysis for breaks
  - [x] Implement day-of-week analysis
  - [ ] Create functions for session-based analysis (Asia, Europe, US)
  - [ ] Analyze holiday vs. normal day behavior

- [ ] **3.2 Market Context Analysis**
  - [ ] Add volatility measurement around breaks
  - [ ] Implement volume analysis pre/post break
  - [ ] Create market regime detection (trending vs. ranging)
  - [ ] Analyze behavior during major market events

- [ ] **3.3 Sequential Pattern Analysis**
  - [ ] Track sequences of breaks (multiple in same day)
  - [ ] Analyze behavior after consecutive day breaks
  - [ ] Implement pattern recognition for common setups
  - [ ] Create metrics for streak analysis

## Phase 4: Visualization and Reporting
- [x] **4.1 Charting Module**
  - [ ] Create candlestick charts with break points marked
  - [x] Implement heat maps for time-based analysis
  - [x] Add distribution charts for continuation/reversal metrics
  - [ ] Create interactive charts for exploration

- [x] **4.2 Comprehensive Report Generator**
  - [x] Implement markdown/HTML report generation
  - [ ] Create templates for different analysis types
  - [x] Add executive summary with key findings
  - [x] Include detailed statistics and methodology

- [ ] **4.3 Interactive Dashboard**
  - [ ] Create web-based dashboard for result browsing
  - [ ] Add filters for different parameters
  - [ ] Implement comparison views for different settings
  - [ ] Create export functionality for further analysis

## Phase 5: Parameter Optimization and Validation
- [ ] **5.1 Parameter Testing Framework**
  - [ ] Create grid search for optimal parameters
  - [ ] Implement cross-validation to prevent overfitting
  - [ ] Add sensitivity analysis for key parameters
  - [ ] Create reporting for parameter testing results

- [ ] **5.2 Strategy Simulation**
  - [ ] Implement simple trading logic based on findings
  - [ ] Create performance metrics for simulated trades
  - [ ] Add position sizing and risk management
  - [ ] Compare with baseline strategies
